        <span class="A">A</span>stronomy is the study of everything in the universe beyond Earth’s atmosphere. 
        That includes objects we can see with our naked eyes, like the Sun , the Moon , the planets, and the stars .
         It also includes objects we can only see with telescopes or other instruments, like faraway galaxies and tiny particles.
          And it even includes questions about things we can't see at all, like dark matter and dark energy .

        <h1>What are the big ideas about astronomy?</h1>
        <h2>1.When we look up at the night sky, we see patterns and want to explain them</h2>

        <p>
            Early observers looking at the night sky noticed patterns in the stars .
             These patterns, which we call constellations, might appear to change place, but they don’t change shape. 
             People around the world gave them names (like  Orion the hunter or Leo the lion) and told stories about them. 
             You may know some of these stories as myths, or as astrology. Astrology can be fun to think about, but it’s different from astronomy.
              Astrology is not science!
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Early observers also noticed some bright objects in the sky that seem to wander around among the stars.
             The ancient Greek philosophers called these objects “planets,” which is Greek for “wanderers.” The planets are our near neighbors, and they do move.
              They orbit the Sun , just as Earth does.
        </p>
        <h2>2. The sky is vast and distances between objects can be very large</h2>
       
       <div class="parent">

            <img src="images/landing2.jpg" alt="">

            <p class="par"> 
                To the naked eye, the stars look like tiny points of light . But stars are not tiny—they're huge, 
                burning balls of gas, like our Sun. They just appear small because they are so far away. The nearest star to our solar system is 4 light years away,
                 which is 20 trillion miles.</p> </div>

                The stars of the Big Dipper may all look the same distance away, as if they were pasted on the wall of a giant dome.
            </p>
          <h2>3. Everything in space is moving all the time</h2>

          <p>You might feel like you’re sitting still, but you’re actually flying through space incredibly fast! That’s because Earth is carrying you like a spaceship. </p>
            <p class="par2">Earth is spinning. If you were standing on the equator, you and the spot under your feet would be rotating at a speed of about a thousand miles per hour. 
            But Earth is also orbiting around the Sun, moving even faster: 67,000 miles per hour. And the Sun itself is moving around the center of our galaxy, carrying 
            everything in the solar system with it, at a rate of 490,000 miles per hour. And that’s not all. Our galaxy, the Milky Way , is moving too—at a rate of 872,405 miles per hour. 
            Our cluster of galaxies is moving too. And so is everything else in the universe</p>
         <h2>4. Gravity holds everything together</h2>
         <p>
            If Earth is moving so fast, why don’t we fly off? Thank gravity for that. Gravity is the force of attraction between all objects in the universe. An object’s gravity depends on
             its mass —its total amount of matter , or “stuff.” The more massive the object, the stronger the gravitational force. And the closer two objects are, the stronger the gravitational
              pull between them. Gravity is what keeps your feet on the ground—and what keeps Earth and the planets orbiting around the Sun instead of floating away. 
         </p>
         <p>When you jump, you always fall back to Earth. What goes up must come down, right? Not quite! Something can go up and not come down if it reaches the escape velocity, the speed at which
          it breaks free from a planet’s gravitational pull. That’s how rockets work. Their engines are designed to push the rocket up so hard that it moves fast enough to get away. The universe is 
          full of “runaway” stars and planets that escaped the gravity of their neighbors.
        </p>
        <h2>
            5. There’s much more to light than our eyes can see
        </h2>
        <p>
            Light is a form of energy called electromagnetic radiation. We see objects because they reflect, or bounce, light into our eyes. But there’s a whole spectrum of electromagnetic radiation,
             and our eyes can detect only a teeny, tiny portion of it. That portion—visible light—consists of different wavelengths of light that we perceive as different colors. If you think of the 
             electromagnetic spectrum as a piano keyboard, visible light is the equivalent of a single octave. Objects in space are emitting or reflecting radiation from all across the spectrum, 
             including ultraviolet (UV), infrared, microwaves, and radio waves. To see this invisible electromagnetic radiation, we need to use special tools like microwave telescopes and gamma-ray
              telescopes.
