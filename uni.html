    <font size="400"> Our planet, Earth, is an oasis not only in space, but in time. It may feel permanent, but the
      entire planet is a fleeting thing in the lifespan of the universe.
      For nearly two-thirds of the time since the universe began, Earth did not even exist. Nor will it last forever in
      its current state. Several billion years from now,
      the Sun will expand, swallowing Mercury and Venus, and filling Earth’s sky. It might even expand large enough to
      swallow Earth itself. It’s difficult to be certain.
      After all, humans have only just begun deciphering the cosmos.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the distant future is difficult to accurately predict, the distant past is slightly less so. By studying the
    radioactive decay of isotopes on Earth and in asteroids,
    scientists have learned that our planet and the solar system formed around 4.6 billion years ago. </pre>

    </h2>
  </u>
  <p>
    <font size="400">The universe contains all the energy and matter there is.
      Much of the observable matter in the universe takes the form of individual atoms
      of hydrogen, which is the simplest atomic element, made of only a proton and an
      electron (if the atom also contains a neutron, it is instead called deuterium).
      Two or more atoms sharing electrons is a molecule. Many trillions of atoms together
      is a dust particle. Smoosh a few tons of carbon, silica, oxygen, ice, and some metals
      together, and you have an asteroid. Or collect 333,000 Earth masses of hydrogen and
      helium together, and you have a Sun-like star.</font>

  <font size="200"><u> Planet : Wanderers of Solar System</u></font>

  <p>
    <font size="400">The word planet means <i>‘wanderer’</i>. This is because
      the planets do appear to wander listlessly across the night sky.
      The stars also move across the sky east to west but relative
      to each other, they appear fixed. The planets, on the other hand,
      seem to move relative to the fixed stars in backward and forwards
      directions. This is why they were called Wanderers.

  <font size="200">A planet is a large celestial body that revolves around the sun in fixed orbits.
    Planets do not have any light of their own but reflect the light of the sun. Planets also do not
    twinkle like stars because they are much closer to us. The earth is also a planet and is the only
    place we know in the universe to harbour life.</font>
